      Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
      their meat and eggs) and as pets. Chickens are one of the most common and
      widespread domestic animals, with a total <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population" id="population"> population </a></b> of 23.7 billion as of 2018, <sup><a href="about.html"> [3]</a></sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011.<sup>[4]</sup> There are more chickens
      in the world than any other bird.<sup>[4]</sup> There are numerous cultural
      references to chickens â€“ in myth, folklore and religion, and in language
      and literature.

      studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast
      Asia, and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the
      Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. <br>
      ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
      Greece by the 5th century BC.<sup>[6]</sup> Fowl have been known in Egypt since the
      mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
      come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the
      annals of Thutmose III.<sup>[7][8][9]</sup>
